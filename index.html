                <h2>Static Scenarios</h2>
                <p>To create static scenarios is pretty simple, all you need to do is create a scenario in the builder
                    then set it to Clicking category, after this you need to create the target the best kind of target
                    for this category is Sphere. After creating the target go to behavior, create a behavior → frame →
                    new action and select "Set Waypoint". Set Waypoint is where you will set up the bot spawn.</p>
                <p>Teleport = On |</p>
                <p>Prevent Targets Collision On + set it to 2 or 3 for a good distance from each other |</p>
                <p>After that you will need to choose a type of waypoint, for static scenarios doesnt matter wich one
                    you will pick so choose whatever you want. After choosing it you will set the values for the bot
                    spawn.</p>
                <p>X = Horizontal Spawn values</p>
                <p>Y = Vertical Spawn values</p>
                <p>Z = Forward / Backward Spawn Values ( if you choose Orbit, Distance is the same as Z Axis).</p>
                <p> We have a Preset to help you to understand + create your scenarios faster:</p>

            <section id="DynamicClicking">
                <h2>Dynamic Clicking Scenarios</h2>
                <p>For Dynamic the idea is the same but here we need to use Orbit to set better movement for our
                    Targets.</p>
                <p> Here you need to set the spawn to Orbit but also add some new Actions to the spawn behavior </p>
                <p> Actions you will need:</p>
                <p> Max Speed (Controls the target's speed)</p>
                <p> Rubber Stiffness (Controls an invisible line that pulls the target to the direction)(XYZ) </p>
                <p> Orbit Restriction (Controls the limits for the target move around) </p>

                <p> After setting up all this you will need to create a new behavior for the targets movement. To Create
                    movement behaviors you will need
                    Set Waypoint but for movement you disable the teleport option.
                </p>
                <p> You will set XYZ Axis just like the spawn but for movement so just try values and limits, also, the
                    higher the rubber stiffness more reactive the target will be. </p>
                <p> Make 2 Frames for movement, Left and Right. On X Axis you will set negative number for left and
                    positive number for right.</p>
                <p> The distance on movement needs to be the same as the Orbit restriction, if you set it different the
                    target won't work correctly. The Y Axis you will set a range of a negative number and a positive
                    number, for example:</p>
                <p> Y Axis = -15 / 15. This means that the bot can move in a range of -15 (down) and +15 (up).</p>
                <p> After setting this things all you will need to do is test and improve your values and behaviors.</p>

            <section id="GroundTracking">
                <h2>Ground Tracking Scenarios</h2>
                <p> For ground tracking you will keep the same attributes of dynamic clicking but now the target model
                    will be a pill and you will set his Y Spawn Axis to the ground.</p>
                <p> After setting it to the ground and changing the model to pill we need to make sure that the bot
                    won't fly around the map, so, go on Max Speed and set Y to 0 </p>
                <p> Now all you need to do is change values to fit what you want to create, making it fast if its
                    reactive,slow and smoother for categories like stability, etc... </p>

                <h2>Air Scenarios</h2>
                <p>For air scenarios all you need to do is get the dynamic logic and apply to a Sphere Target with all
                    axis speed set </p>
                <p> You can make it smooth, reactive, impossible to hit, all you want, just try values to fit what you
                    want.</p>

            <section id="DashSkill">
                <h2>Dash Skill</h2>
                <p>To add a skill like Dashes to a target it’s necessary to understand how EasyAim timings work.</p>

                <p> First you need to set a target time like, by default 0 (The target will start the timer at 0 and go
                    up).
                    After setting up the target time you can make your default movement configuration but you need to
                    add one new action called “On Target Time Reached” on your Target’s movement behavior.
                </p>


                <p>
                    After that you will need to create a new behavior for your Dash Skill (or whatever you want to call
                    it).
                    Also create a “reset speed” frame on your movement behavior.

                    How it works:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bot starts his behavior on time 0, he moves normally like designed but when it hits the time
                    that you set up on “On Target Time Reached” it applies the Dash Skill Behavior.
                    The Dash Behavior needs to be a very rough and fast movement so you’ll set it up with very high
                    speed and rubber stiffness, but after making the dash happen you need the bot to go back to normal,
                    that’s where the “Reset Speed” joins the party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reset speed will set the Target’s speed to the default one that you set up on his Spawn Behavior.
                    ( Make sure to set it to the same as the Spawn one )
                    So after resetting the speed it starts the movement loop again.
                </p>
            </section>

           
            <section id="GauntletScenarios">
                <h2>Gauntlet Scenarios</h2>
                <p>Gauntlets are a type of scenario where there’s 2 or more target profiles that run at different times.
                </p>
                <p>First of all we need to make sure that we have a behavior that takes the bot out of the playable area
                    and teleports it outside of it.</p>
                <p> Make a behavior called "Spawn Out of Map" and set the spawn to outside of the playable area. </p>
                <p> Second, you will need to make different behaviors for each target, as the example above where i
                    called them Bot 1, 2 & 3.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All these behaviors have two “Actions” called “Set Target Time” and “On Target Time Reached” which
                    means that the target has a time where you set it to 0 and it starts counting the Target time from
                    it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Target Time Reached means that after the target gets out of 0 to the time you set up on this
                    action it will make another action and here is where you set it to Spawn out of map.
                </p>
                <p> After you complete these steps you will need to just set up the target's initial behavior delay to
                    match what timings you want in your scenario.</p>
