                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to EasyAim's Documentation Page.</p>
                <p>Here you'll find all the explanations you need to create quality scenarios using our builder.
                    After reading this documentation, it's very important to practice and test different configurations so you can become familiar with the builder.
                    If you still have questions, feel free to ask @mira_r3d on EasyAim's Discord.

            <section id="Basics">
                <h2>Basics</h2>
                <p>Here are some basics you need to understand before using our builder:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>EasyAim uses seconds and milliseconds for timings and other measurements.</li>
                    <li>Scenario maximum duration is 2 minutes (120 seconds).</li>
                    <li>When turning Automatic Assault Rifle on, your fire rate will be 1000ms, meaning you will register 1000 hits every second.</li>
                    <li>The maximum room size is 500 units on all axes.</li>
                    <li>EasyAim uses XYZ axes for directions.</li>
                    <li>X-Axis = Horizontal | Y-Axis = Vertical | Z-Axis = Forward/Backward (negative values mean left/down/backward and positive values mean right/up/forward).</li>
                    <li>Gravity: Negative values = Push the target down | Positive values = Push the target up</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="Targets">
                <h2>Targets</h2>
                <p>For Targets, we have 4 different options: Cube, Sphere, Capsule (Pill) & Body (Pill + Head).</p>
                <p>In Target configuration, you can set: Size, Shape, Health lost on hits, scoring per hit/elimination, maximum health, and the behavior that target will use.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="Behaviors">
                <h2>Behaviors</h2>
                <p>Behaviors are the actions that the bot will execute. These can include spawns, movement, teleports, dashes, or any action you want to create.</p>
                <p>In the behavior configuration, you have Behaviors, Frames, and Actions. What does each one do?</p>
                <p>Behaviors and Frames are like folders. Imagine you have a game installed on your PC and you want to find its configuration file to change your settings. Most games have folders inside other folders, and the config file will be inside those folders. It's the same with Behaviors, Frames, and Actions.</p>
                <p>Behavior is the main folder (parent folder), Frames are the folders inside the behavior, and Actions are the files.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="Static">
                <h2>How to Make Static Clicking Scenarios</h2>
                <p>Creating static scenarios is straightforward. First, create a scenario in the builder and set it to the Clicking category. Then create a target—the best kind of target for this category is Sphere. After creating the target, go to Behaviors, create a behavior → frame → new action, and select "Set Waypoint". Set Waypoint is where you'll configure the bot spawn.</p>
                <p><strong>Settings:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Teleport = On</li>
                    <li>Prevent Targets Collision = On, set to 2 or 3 for good spacing between targets</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After that, you'll need to choose a type of waypoint. For static scenarios, it doesn't matter which one you pick, so choose whatever you prefer. After choosing, you'll set the values for the bot spawn:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>X = Horizontal spawn values</li>
                    <li>Y = Vertical spawn values</li>
                    <li>Z = Forward/Backward spawn values (if you choose Orbit, Distance is the same as the Z-Axis)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We have a preset to help you understand and create your scenarios faster:</p>

            <section id="DynClicking">
                <h2>How to Make Dynamic Clicking Scenarios</h2>
                <p>For dynamic scenarios, the idea is similar, but here we need to use Orbit to create better movement for our targets.</p>
                <p>You need to set the spawn to Orbit and also add some new actions to the spawn behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Actions you'll need:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Max Speed (controls the target's speed)</li>
                    <li>Rubber Stiffness (controls an invisible line that pulls the target in a direction on XYZ axes)</li>
                    <li>Orbit Restriction (controls the limits for the target to move around)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After setting up all of this, you'll need to create a new behavior for the target's movement. To create movement behaviors, you'll use Set Waypoint, but for movement, you disable the teleport option.</p>
                <p>You'll set XYZ axes just like the spawn but for movement, so experiment with values and limits. Also, the higher the rubber stiffness, the more reactive the target will be.</p>
                <p>Create 2 frames for movement: Left and Right. On the X-Axis, you'll set negative numbers for left and positive numbers for right.</p>
                <p>The distance on movement needs to match the Orbit restriction. If you set them differently, the target won't work correctly. For the Y-Axis, you'll set a range between a negative number and a positive number, for example:</p>
                <p>Y-Axis = -15 / 15. This means the bot can move in a range of -15 (down) and +15 (up).</p>
                <p>After setting these parameters, all you need to do is test and refine your values and behaviors.</p>

            <section id="Groundtracking">
                <h2>How to Make Ground Tracking Scenarios</h2>
                <p>For ground tracking, you'll keep the same attributes as dynamic clicking, but now the target model will be a Pill, and you'll set its Y spawn axis to the ground.</p>
                <p>After setting it to the ground and changing the model to Pill, we need to ensure the bot won't fly around the map. Go to Max Speed and set Y to 0.</p>
                <p>Now all you need to do is adjust values to fit what you want to create—making it fast for reactive tracking, slow and smooth for categories like stability, etc.</p>

            <section id="AirTracking">
                <h2>How to Make Air Tracking Scenarios</h2>
                <p>For air scenarios, all you need to do is take the dynamic logic and apply it to a Sphere target with all axis speeds set.</p>
                <p>You can make it smooth, reactive, impossible to hit—whatever you want. Just experiment with values to achieve your desired result.</p>
